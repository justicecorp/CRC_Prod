- Add in cypress testing to the dev build workflow. It will simply check if a value exists for the counter for now. As the site is expanded it can do more testing. 
    - So long as the site is up and the counter is there, create a PR from Test->main in the workflow. 
    - Perform Cypress API testing. Add this as a step in tf-build-dev.yml
    - Afterwards, if all tests pass, add the creation of a PR from Test -> Prod in tf-build-dev.yml
- Devise CloudWatch alarms that should be in place to monitor the environment. Monitor APIGW, Lambda, CF
    - Eventually integrate these with an SNS topic. Integrate the SNS topic with a 3rd party notification service. 


Immediate needs:
1. Get Cypress test to return sucess when run from a GHA (it works when run directly in cypress)
2. Test the PR and Issue automatic creation that is added to the tf-build-DEV workflow



Troubleshooting Cypress:
- Thrown issue: Error: Action failed. Missing package manager lockfile. Expecting one of package-lock.json (npm), pnpm-lock.yaml (pnpm) or yarn.lock (yarn) in working-directory /home/runner/work/CRC_Prod/CRC_Prod
- This is a good example of a folder structure: https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#working-directory
    - This also shows that we can use the 'working-directory' attribute so we can keep our cypress stuff separate from other things
- ***** THE PLACE WHERE I INSTALLED CYPRESS ON MY WORK LAPTOP (ie. ~/package-lock.json) HAS THE FILES. WHEN DO THEY GET GENERATED? HOW DO I GENERATE THEM IN MY PROIJECT????????

Steps:
- figure out where the hell the package-lock.json file is meant to come from
- FIGURE OUT HOW TO GENERATE PACKAGE.JSON. I THINK THIS MUST BE DONE FIRST. THEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE A PACKAGE-LOCK.JSON (it references package.json)
