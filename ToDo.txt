- Implement Signed GIT Commits
    - Installed GPG Suite, created a key, configured it at github, and the local git configuration for signing all local commits
- Add in cypress testing to the dev build workflow. It will simply check if a value exists for the counter for now. As the site is expanded it can do more testing. 
    - So long as the site is up and the counter is there, create a PR from Test->main in the workflow. 
    - Perform Cypress API testing. Add this as a step in tf-build-dev.yml
    - Afterwards, if all tests pass, add the creation of a PR from Test -> Prod in tf-build-dev.yml
- Devise CloudWatch alarms that should be in place to monitor the environment. Monitor APIGW, Lambda, CF
    - Eventually integrate these with an SNS topic. Integrate the SNS topic with a 3rd party notification service. 
- Create some CloudWatch alarms that monitor APIGW, Lambda, etc. Add this to IAC.
